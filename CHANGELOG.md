## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-25

### Breaking Changes
- **ESM Migration**: The project has been fully migrated to ECMAScript Modules (ESM). This resolves `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` issues with modern dependencies.
- **Baileys v7**: Upgraded to `@whiskeysockets/baileys@7.0.0-rc.9`. This brings support for the new WhatsApp LID (Local Identifier) system.
- **Node.js Requirement**: Minimum Node.js version is now `v20.17.0` (or `v20.0.0` with compatible npm).

### Changed
- Replaced `ts-node` with `tsx` for a better ESM development experience.
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to use `Node16` resolution.
- Fixed `node-sqlite3-wasm` imports for ESM compatibility.
- Added `postbuild` script to automatically set executable permissions on the CLI binary.
- Optimized dependency list (removed unnecessary build tools).

## [0.8.6] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- Added `node-addon-api` as a dependency to improve compatibility with `sharp` (native dependency of Baileys).

## [0.8.5] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- Rename package to `@thiagobarbosa-dev/whatscli` to avoid naming conflicts on NPM registry.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- Fix binary executable path in `package.json` to ensure `whatscli` command is correctly installed via NPM.
- Resolve minor `package.json` inconsistencies via `npm pkg fix`.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- Handle `EPIPE` (Broken Pipe) errors gracefully when piping output to other commands (e.g., `head`), preventing Node.js crashes.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- Resolve module path aliases (`@/`) at build-time using `tsc-alias`, eliminating runtime dependency on `tsconfig.json`.
- Remove `tsconfig-paths/register` from production entrypoint.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- Resolve module path aliases (`@/`) in production builds using `tsconfig-paths`.
- Move `tsconfig-paths` to production dependencies.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- GitHub Actions CI workflow — runs type-check and 17 unit tests on Node.js 20.x and 22.x on every push and PR.
- Security audit job in CI — blocks PRs if any critical vulnerability is detected.
- `.github/SECURITY.md` — responsible disclosure policy with private reporting via GitHub Security Advisories.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- `"prepare": "npm run build"` script — enables `npm install -g` global installation.
- `"files"` whitelist in `package.json` — only ships `dist/`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `CHANGELOG.md` to npm.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — setup guide, code style rules, and PR contribution workflow.
- Unit tests with Vitest — 17 tests covering `jid.utils.ts` and `output/formatter.ts`.

### Changed
- `Browsers.macOS` replaced with `Browsers.ubuntu` for cross-platform server compatibility.
- `normalizeJid` no longer assumes Brazil (+55) as default country code — full international number now required.
- Refactored dynamic `require()` calls in `messages.ts` to static imports.

### Fixed
- Patched critical `protobufjs` vulnerability (GHSA-xq3m-2v4x-88gg) via `npm audit fix`.
- Removed stray `list_groups.ts` debug file from repository root.
- Removed `package-lock.json` from `.gitignore` to guarantee reproducible installs.

- `chat_name` and `sender_name` added to OpenClaw JSON payload via SQLite JOINs on contacts and chats tables.

### Changed
- Enforced strict `OpenClawOutput` interface in JSON mode — no internal Baileys fields leak to stdout.
- Redirected pino `DEBUG` and `INFO` logs strictly to `stderr` to guarantee flawless NDJSON output on `stdout`.
